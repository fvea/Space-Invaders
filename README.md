## Game Instructions

In Space Invaders, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the **right and left arrow keys**, respectively, and shoot bullets using the **spacebar**. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
